Okay, here is the works assignments for the IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:

Ryan Lee, Matthew Liang, Chris Berkowitz, Yash Jaradi => Controllers
Chris Cruz, Muhammad Naviwala => Views
Gabe Ohlson, Joel Loucks => Models

But note that these areas assigned are the areas you need to CONCENTRATE on, not work on EXCLUSIVELY.
EVERYBODY must promote COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP of code otherwise INTEGRATION will be a HASSLE!!!

Let's not LOOSE points for this part!!!

DEADLINE for all working deliverables is Monday April 22!!
